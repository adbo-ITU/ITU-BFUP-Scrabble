## Points we've aimed for
- [x] 2 points - Finish a game against yourself on an infinite board (you do not have to count points nor play well)
- [x] 1 point - Multiplayer and implement your dictionary
- [x] 1 point - Parellise your algorithm
- [ ] 1 point - Use the DSL to parse the board and calculate points
- [x] 1 point - Respect the timeout flag

## How to run
### Using .NET
Requires .NET v6 to be installed. Our `dotnet --version` outputs `6.0.104`. To run:
